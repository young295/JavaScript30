# JavaScript30
Javascript course with 30 separate small projects included.

This is a set of mini projects, or assignments, from an online video series course by Wes Bos that I am following to learn some useful applications of Javascript and generally hone my skills. Each Project uses only vanilla javascript and css, with no frameworks, to complete various tasks. 

While some of the topics of these assignments are more relevant or useful than others, by completing all of them, I will have mastered the basics and learned some new and interesting features that I will be able to use to apply to my own projects in the future.
